  // Proper reconstruction for time at sample for each event requires that we subtract travel time from sample to detector from event time at the detector.
  // This requires wavelength of the neutron and distance along the beam path from sample to detector. If the rocking motor is an analyzer then the wavelength, and hence the travel time, will depend on motor position.
  // Some of this information, such as sample to detector distance, may not be under motor control, and therefore unknown to Nice. This should be stored in the nexus instrument definition provided to nice by the instrument scientist and used to construct the nexus file.
